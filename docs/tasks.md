API documentation : 'docs/api-documentation.md'

## Code Quality and Consistency

1. [x] **Standardize Error Handling**
   - [x] Implement a global error handling service that centralizes error processing
   - [x] Create consistent error messages and user notifications
   - [x] Remove logging for production environment

2. [x] **TypeScript Model Consistency**
   - [x] Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to all model interfaces

3. [X] **Component Lifecycle Management**
   - [X] Ensure proper subscription cleanup in all components
   - [X] Standardize component initialization patterns
   - [X] Implement proper loading and error states for async operations

## Architecture Improvements

4. [X] **State Management Standardization**
   - [X] Choose Signals as the primary state management approach
   - [X] Refactor services to use the chosen approach consistently

5. [X] **Module Organization**
   - [X] Review and optimize lazy loading strategy for all routes

## Testing Strategy

6. [ ] **Unit Testing Coverage**
    - [ ] Increase unit test coverage for services to at least 60%

7. [ ] **Component Testing**
    - [ ] Add tests for all shared components
    - [ ] Ensure proper testing of component lifecycle methods

## Performance Optimizations

8. [X] **Rendering Performance**
    - [X] Optimize change detection strategies
    - [X] Use OnPush change detection where appropriate

9. [ ] **Asset Optimization**
    - [ ] Use ngSrc for image display

## UI/UX Improvements

10. [ ] **Responsive Design**
    - [ ] Ensure all components work properly on mobile devices
    - [ ] Implement responsive layouts for all pages
    - [ ] Add touch-friendly interactions for mobile users

11. [ ] **UI Consistency**
    - [ ] Standardize color palette and typography
    - [ ] Use SCSS variables for all styling : 
    - Note Be careful on the use of themes colors, as some components would use secondary instead of primary, etc... Always check for the design to be consistent and coherent
    - [ ] Implement consistent spacing and layout patterns
    - Note : A full Material Theme is located in 'src/styles/_theme.scss'
