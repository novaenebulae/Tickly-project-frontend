**Current State:** The application has performance issues with complex views and doesn't consistently use optimized change detection strategies.

**Recommended Actions:**
- Use OnPush change detection for all components
- Optimize component initialization and destruction
- Use trackBy functions for all ngFor directives

**Rationale:** These optimizations will significantly improve application performance, especially for complex views with many components. OnPush change detection reduces unnecessary rendering cycles, while virtual scrolling improves performance for large data sets.

### 3.2 Network Optimization

**Current State:** API requests are not optimized for performance, leading to unnecessary network traffic.

**Recommended Actions:**
- Implement request debouncing for search inputs

**Rationale:** Network optimizations will improve application responsiveness and reduce server load. Caching and pagination are particularly important for mobile users who may have limited bandwidth.

### 3.3 Asset Optimization

**Current State:** Static assets are not optimized, leading to longer load times.

**Recommended Actions:**
- Optimize and compress static assets
- Use ngSrc for image display with proper lazy loading
- Use appropriate image formats (WebP where supported)

**Rationale:** Asset optimization directly impacts initial load time and overall application performance. Modern image formats and lazy loading techniques can significantly reduce bandwidth usage and improve perceived performance.

## 4. Testing Strategy

### 4.1 Unit Testing Coverage

**Current State:** Unit test coverage is insufficient, particularly for services and complex business logic.

**Recommended Actions:**
- Increase unit test coverage for services to at least 80%
- Add comprehensive tests for complex business logic
