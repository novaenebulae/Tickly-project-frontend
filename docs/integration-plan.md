# Tickly Frontend Integration Plan


## Overview
This document outlines the integration plan for implementing the tasks specified in `docs/tasks.md`. The plan is organized to maximize efficiency and minimize redundant work.

## Approach
We'll implement the tasks in a logical order that allows us to build upon previous work. For each task:
1. Analyze the current implementation
2. Make the necessary changes
3. Create unit tests where appropriate
4. Verify that the changes meet the requirements

## Task Grouping and Order
Tasks are grouped by related functionality and ordered by dependency.

### Group 1: Foundation Improvements
These tasks establish the foundation for other improvements.

#### Task 1: Standardize Error Handling => DONE
- Create a global error handling service in `src/app/core/services/error-handling.service.ts`
- Implement consistent error messages and notifications
- Configure production environment to remove logging
- Update existing services to use the new error handling approach

#### Task 2: TypeScript Model Consistency => DONE
- Add JSDoc comments to all model interfaces
- Ensure models are properly typed
- Focus on models in `src/app/core/models`

### Group 2: Architecture and Performance
These tasks improve the overall architecture and performance of the application.

#### Task 3: State Management Standardization => DONE
- Implement Signals as the primary state management approach
- Refactor services to use Signals consistently
- Update components to consume state from Signals

#### Task 4: Component Lifecycle Management => DONE
- Ensure proper subscription cleanup in all components
- Standardize component initialization patterns
- Implement proper loading and error states for async operations

#### Task 5: Module Organization => DONE
- Review and optimize lazy loading strategy for all routes
- Ensure proper module boundaries

#### Task 6: Rendering Performance => DONE
- Optimize change detection strategies
- Use OnPush change detection where appropriate

#### Task 7: Asset Optimization => DONE
- Use ngSrc for image display
- Optimize asset loading

### Group 3: UI/UX Improvements
These tasks enhance the user interface and experience.

Note : A full Material Theme is located in 'src/styles/_theme.scss'
- The goal is to have a consistent and uniformized design of the app.

IMPORTANT : Here are some guidelines of how the style should be : 'docs/design-guidelines.md'

#### Task 8: UI Consistency => DONE
- Standardize color palette and typography according to design guidelines
- Use SCSS variables for all styling
- Implement consistent spacing and layout patterns
- Replace deprecated darken() and lighten() functions

#### Task 9: Responsive Design => PARTIALLY DONE
- Ensure all components work properly on mobile devices
- Implement responsive layouts for all pages
- Add touch-friendly interactions for mobile users 

#### Task 10: User Experience Enhancements => DONE
- Enhance error messages with actionable information
- Upgrade notification system to use snackbar notifications

### Group 4: Testing and Documentation
These tasks improve the quality and maintainability of the codebase.

#### Task 11: Unit Testing Coverage
- Increase unit test coverage for services for 60% of test coverage
- Focus on critical services first

#### Task 12: Component Testing
- Add tests for shared components
- Ensure proper testing of component lifecycle methods

#### Task 13: Code Documentation
- Add JSDoc comments to all public methods and classes
- Document complex business logic and algorithms

## Dependencies and Considerations
- Error handling should be implemented first as other tasks depend on it
- State management standardization should be done early as it affects many components
- UI consistency should be addressed before responsive design
- Testing should be done alongside implementation
